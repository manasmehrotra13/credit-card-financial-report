CREDIT CARD FINANCIAL REPORT

Iâ€™ve put together a detailed project using Excel, PostgreSQL, and Power BI. My goal was to uncover insightful trends in credit card usage across different customer segments. Along the way, I used a range of methods and analytical techniques to make sure the results were spot on.

OBJECTIVE- To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.
